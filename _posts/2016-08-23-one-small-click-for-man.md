  So I’ve finally got round to playing around with something I’m very excited
  about: The Grid. The idea of this bit of software is that it can design your
  website around the content that you post on it. Depending on how this test
  site goes, I’ll be making more websites on here and even suggesting them to
  clients.

So I've finally got round to playing around with something I'm very excited about: The Grid. The idea of this bit of software is that it can design your website around the content that you post on it. Depending on how this test site goes, I'll be making more websites on here and even suggesting them to clients.

This content is supposed to be on a separate page. Typing in here to see what the first paragraph looks like...

And here to see if there's any change for the second!
